## What is OSSP?
One Stop Service Platform (OSSP) is an automated process re-engineering service that maintains enhanced security, privacy as well as audit logs. It is an incredibly useful framework that introduces various latest features with extra layer security and reliability.

As a centralized system, this framework reduces process time
and expenses, also offers end-to-end application process with
data transparency, security and non-repudiation. This
platform independent framework has central login facility and
authentication system where multi-level security is ensured
from a single point. Hence, with single credentials (one email
and password), it is possible in OSSP to access multiple authorized systems. Third-party login systems such as Google and
UDC (Union Digital Center) are also available here. Moreover, its
scalability allows integration of multiple services.
